# Build status

Orchestration state for the overnight run. Every agent appends here; the orchestrator
reads this first on each wake-up.

## Assumptions made without the user

Emil is asleep. These were decided autonomously and are cheap to reverse in the morning.

- Code lives in `photographic/` inside the `aqanto-landing-page` repo so it can be
  lifted out later with `git subtree split` without touching the landing page.
- "Done" means: Claude can connect to the MCP server and answer questions about the
  person, **and** an invite to a shared room works end to end.
- Technical decisions taken freely. Nothing decided about pricing, naming or legal.
- Embeddings sized at 1536 (`text-embedding-3-small`). Changing this is a migration.
- Swedish for user-facing strings, English for code.
- No API key was available at the start of the run, so `LlmPort` is built against a
  deterministic fake first and the real implementation second.

## Blockers

_Agents append here. Do not edit another package to unblock yourself._

- **orchestrator → web agent**: `apps/onboarding/src/styles/tokens.css` duplicates
  `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`. Both were written from `DESIGN.md` in parallel so
  they agree, but they should be lifted into one shared package when the two apps are
  merged. Not urgent, and not something either of us should fix unilaterally.

## In progress

- **orchestrator** — public HTTPS so Claude can connect for real (tunnel or
  Fly+Postgres), deeper `VITE_USE_DEMO=0` wiring, design round 4 (invite CTA
  above-fold confidence, Dokument section, less “status dashboard” on Klienter).
  Deploy scaffolding (`Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, migrate-on-start, `scripts/deploy.md`)
  is in place; Postgres adapters are assembled and `DATABASE_URL` boots cleanly.

## Completed

- **orchestrator** — foundation: pnpm workspace, frozen SQL schema (applied and tested
  against local Postgres 16 + pgvector), `@photographic/core` domain types, all ports,
  policy constants, `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  Verified by hand: append-only trigger rejects UPDATE and DELETE on `app.event`; only
  one personal room per person; a non-member resolves to zero accessible rooms.

- **orchestrator** — `@photographic/connect`: passwordless sign-up, the connect screen
  as data, one-click install links, and delivery verification. 66 tests, no database
  and no network. Decision recorded in `CONNECT.md`: one shared MCP URL for everyone,
  identity from OAuth, never a per-person address.
  Verified by decoding our own Cursor deeplink: the payload is the bare transport
  config, with no `mcpServers` wrapper (the wrapper is what makes Cursor reject it).

- **orchestrator** — `apps/onboarding`: the four screens a new person actually meets.
  Passwordless sign-up, invite landing with the room content shown before any form, the
  connect screen rendered entirely from `@photographic/connect` descriptors, and
  delivery verification. Plus client health with a green/amber/red dot per AI.
  18 tests against a fake API. `pnpm --filter @photographic/onboarding dev` opens
  `/dev.html` and runs the whole flow on fake data, so the screens can be reviewed
  before the backend exists.
  Verified: production build excludes the fake API entirely, and no test reports success
  from a click — only from an observed delivery.

- **orchestrator** — trash, history and the agent contract. Migration 0002 adds the
  30-day trash, the purge function, and the activity view; `app.event` now permits
  exactly one mutation, redaction from inside the purge, and still refuses DELETE.
  `@photographic/agent` holds the eight tools and the session instructions (39 tests).
  `previewImport` turns a pasted ChatGPT memory list into proposals (89 tests in
  connect). `PROTOCOL.md` settles MCP-as-backbone plus four lower-friction surfaces.
  Verified against Postgres: the redaction flag does not leak, DELETE is refused even
  mid-purge, unrelated events survive intact, and text is gone from every referencing
  event after a purge.

- **orchestrator** — `apps/rest`: the HTTP API over the ports, with the middleware order
  stated once and load-bearing (context, CORS, rate limit, auth, immediately in front of
  the routes that need it). `createApp` constructs nothing itself, so the same app runs
  against the reference implementation and against Postgres without a line changing.
  36 tests.
  Verified: every 404 is padded to a floor, because "exists but you may not see it" and
  "does not exist" have to be indistinguishable and response time leaks the difference
  for free.

- **orchestrator** — `apps/mcp`: the MCP server, mounted at `/mcp` on the same origin as
  the API. Per-person instructions in `InitializeResult`, so a model has the profile
  before the person types anything, one session per connection rather than per request,
  and the data boundary applied to every read. 39 tests, including the real client SDK
  over a socket.
  One origin, not two: a client discovers the authorization server from the MCP
  endpoint's own metadata, and splitting the hosts would mean maintaining two OAuth
  deployments to serve one login.

- **orchestrator** — `@photographic/auth`: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and open dynamic
  registration, which is what makes one-click connection possible — nobody visits a
  developer console to use their own memory. Registration being open is also why the
  redirect rules are the only thing between us and a code delivered to an attacker, so
  they are exact-matched at authorize time, plain `http` is refused off loopback, and
  PKCE is required with no downgrade path. Private-use schemes like `cursor://` are
  allowed, because RFC 8252 recommends reverse-DNS and no shipping client follows it;
  what protects them is PKCE, not the scheme check. 34 tests, written against the
  attacks rather than the happy path.
  `/oauth/authorize` splits in two because Photographic has no passwords: it validates
  everything, parks the request, and sends the browser to a login page that approves it
  with a session token. Fixing the redirect URI and the challenge *before* the person
  sees a login screen is the part that matters — nothing afterwards can move where the
  code goes.
  Verified end to end on a socket and again in `apps/rest/src/connect-flow.test.ts`: a
  401 from `/mcp`, discovery, registration, PKCE, login, approval, code exchange, refresh
  rotation, `initialize` with a real profile, a tool call that writes and finds it again —
  and then the parts that must stop working, a revoked token and a replayed refresh token
  taking its whole family down.

- **orchestrator** — `createWiring`: the composition root, extracted from `server.ts`.
  Builds everything and starts nothing, so the wiring is testable; `server.ts` reads the
  environment, builds it and serves it. This found two seam bugs that every unit test had
  been passing over: the login page pointed at an origin that serves no HTML, and the MCP
  endpoint advertised a scope set with no `offline_access`, which would have handed every
  client an hour of access and no way to renew it.

- **orchestrator** — the room overview: every room a person has now reaches every session
  as one line — name, whether other people write in it, and a headline saying what the
  room is for. The personal room is still injected whole; the others are named, not read.
  This closes the gap between "knows everything about you" and "does not know your rooms
  exist", which is the failure a model cannot notice: it answers from the profile, sounds
  certain, and is wrong about work living in a room it was never told about.
  The headline is its own projection, not the first line of a brief. A brief is what a
  room contains and changes daily; a headline is what a room *is*. The owner's own
  description wins and is never regenerated, so a person can state what every model
  understands a room to be (`PATCH /v1/rooms/:id/description`, capped at the length the
  overview can actually carry). Otherwise it is summarised under its own prompt in the
  job that rebuilds the brief — never on the read path, because session start is a voice
  turn — and the personal room is skipped entirely, which would otherwise mean a model
  call on every fact a person saves about themselves.
  Two bugs fixed on the way, both of which had been passing every test: room titles and
  headlines reached the model in instruction position rather than inside the data
  boundary, so a room named "ignore previous instructions" was a write primitive into
  every session its members opened; and the room list was the first block dropped when
  the budget got tight, which is the one thing it must never be. Headlines now give way
  before room names, and room names never give way at all.
  Not built, deliberately: an MCP tool for describing a room. Eight tools is already at
  the limit where selection accuracy starts to fall, and this is an action a person takes
  in the app once per room, not something a model should be choosing between mid-sentence.

- **orchestrator** — `apps/web`: the room app is no longer a placeholder. Home is a rail
  with the personal room as the default landing (brand, title, lede, token meter, then
  profile sections as card groups), "Alla" opens the room grid (personal first,
  violet-tinted), and shared rooms open with brief + memories. Soft-delete with undo on
  every memory line. Demo data only — the API is not wired yet — so the screens can be
  reviewed on their own. 3 component tests green; `pnpm --filter @photographic/web dev`
  on :5173.
  Design language from `DESIGN.md`: one violet accent, Inter, standing-inside-the-room
  rather than a dashboard.

- **orchestrator** — `@photographic/db`: migrate/reset scripts work against the local
  Postgres (`pnpm db:migrate` is a no-op when the schema is already there; empty ledger
  with existing tables gets recorded rather than re-applied). Postgres ports started for
  identity, rooms, invites, events and permissions; they typecheck. Not yet assembled
  into `createPostgresServices`, so `DATABASE_URL` still refuses to boot — by design,
  until the remaining ports (ingest, projection, bundle, retrieval, trash, history,
  sessions, jobs) land and the e2e harness can run `HARNESS=postgres`.

- **orchestrator** — Postgres composition root landed. `createPostgresServices` wires every
  port (identity → rooms → invites → ingest → projection → bundle → retrieval →
  documents → trash → history → events → sessions → jobs → audit) with the same job
  handlers as memory (`rebuild_projections`, `summarise_document`, `purge_trash`).
  `apps/rest` selects it when `DATABASE_URL` is set; the process no longer exits.
  `e2e` harness runs the same 22-test journey against memory (`HARNESS=memory`) and
  Postgres (default when `databaseUrl` / `DATABASE_URL` is present; resets schema per
  run). Smoke tests in `@photographic/db` cover register → remember → profile and
  invite isolation. All green: db 3, e2e 22×2, rest 53, monorepo typecheck clean.

- **orchestrator** — `PHOTOGRAPHIC_LLM=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` selects `OpenAiLlm`
  via `createLlmFromEnv` in the rest composition root; default remains FakeLlm so the
  suite stays deterministic. Deploy docs and WAKEUP.md cover Fly+Postgres and the flag.

- **orchestrator** — design pass on `apps/web` personal room: fuller violet wash hero that
  fills the first viewport (standing *inside* the room), softer token-meter gradient so
  brand is atmospheric rather than a solid bar, entry motion with reduced-motion respect.
  Round 1 of ≥3 against DESIGN.md; Alla/shared-room screenshots still pending.

- **orchestrator** — `pnpm db:seed` loads Emil + Buyersclub Ledning into local Postgres so
  morning demos and e2e against a real ledger do not start from an empty schema.

- **orchestrator** — root `WAKEUP.md` points at `photographic/WAKEUP.md` and the one
  command that boots API+MCP with migrate+seed; short Swedish handoff for anyone who
  lands in the repo root first.

- **orchestrator** — web design round 2: person/room avatars, a shared hero treatment so
  personal and shared rooms feel like the same place, and Alla polish so the room grid
  reads as standing in the foyer rather than a dashboard tile wall.

- **orchestrator** — Approvals (`Godkänn`) and Client health (`Klienter`) screens in
  `apps/web`: pending proposals to accept or dismiss, and a per-AI green/amber/red
  health view so delivery status is visible without leaving the room app.

- **orchestrator** — REST client scaffold behind `VITE_USE_DEMO` (default demo). Demo data
  stays the review path; `VITE_USE_DEMO=0` is the switch toward a live API without
  forcing that wiring on every `pnpm dev`.

- **orchestrator** — `apps/web` component tests now 11 green (was 3), covering the new
  screens and the shared room chrome from round 2.

- **orchestrator** — invite recipient preview at `/i/:token` outside the shell rail:
  readable room content + one violet “Gå med” (demo join confirm). Growth loop screen
  from DESIGN.md.

- **orchestrator** — web design round 3: standing-inside-the-room polish (hero depth,
  Alla foyer, rail calm). Shared rooms gained a sparse Swedish **Aktivitet** feed.
  REST CORS defaults include `127.0.0.1:5173` so Vite→API works locally. Web tests 15.

- **orchestrator** — calm **Dokument** shelf on personal + shared rooms (demo rows,
  empty copy when none). Room interior now matches DESIGN.md: memories, documents,
  activity.
