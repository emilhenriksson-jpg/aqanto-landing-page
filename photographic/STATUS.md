# Build status

Orchestration state for the overnight run. Every agent appends here; the orchestrator
reads this first on each wake-up.

## Assumptions made without the user

Emil is asleep. These were decided autonomously and are cheap to reverse in the morning.

- Code lives in `photographic/` inside the `aqanto-landing-page` repo so it can be
  lifted out later with `git subtree split` without touching the landing page.
- "Done" means: Claude can connect to the MCP server and answer questions about the
  person, **and** an invite to a shared room works end to end.
- Technical decisions taken freely. Nothing decided about pricing, naming or legal.
- Embeddings sized at 1536 (`text-embedding-3-small`). Changing this is a migration.
- Swedish for user-facing strings, English for code.
- No API key was available at the start of the run, so `LlmPort` is built against a
  deterministic fake first and the real implementation second.

## Blockers

_Agents append here. Do not edit another package to unblock yourself._

- **orchestrator → web agent**: `apps/onboarding/src/styles/tokens.css` duplicates
  `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`. Both were written from `DESIGN.md` in parallel so
  they agree, but they should be lifted into one shared package when the two apps are
  merged. Not urgent, and not something either of us should fix unilaterally.

## Completed

- **orchestrator** — foundation: pnpm workspace, frozen SQL schema (applied and tested
  against local Postgres 16 + pgvector), `@photographic/core` domain types, all ports,
  policy constants, `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  Verified by hand: append-only trigger rejects UPDATE and DELETE on `app.event`; only
  one personal room per person; a non-member resolves to zero accessible rooms.

- **orchestrator** — `@photographic/connect`: passwordless sign-up, the connect screen
  as data, one-click install links, and delivery verification. 66 tests, no database
  and no network. Decision recorded in `CONNECT.md`: one shared MCP URL for everyone,
  identity from OAuth, never a per-person address.
  Verified by decoding our own Cursor deeplink: the payload is the bare transport
  config, with no `mcpServers` wrapper (the wrapper is what makes Cursor reject it).

- **orchestrator** — `apps/onboarding`: the four screens a new person actually meets.
  Passwordless sign-up, invite landing with the room content shown before any form, the
  connect screen rendered entirely from `@photographic/connect` descriptors, and
  delivery verification. Plus client health with a green/amber/red dot per AI.
  18 tests against a fake API. `pnpm --filter @photographic/onboarding dev` opens
  `/dev.html` and runs the whole flow on fake data, so the screens can be reviewed
  before the backend exists.
  Verified: production build excludes the fake API entirely, and no test reports success
  from a click — only from an observed delivery.
